Hi, I'm Jake, and I am looking for a career in the technology industry. I need entry-level experience to get started, however I have previously completed an internship with quants and network research.
I am eager to learn new skills and to adapt to new environments. I have a passion for learning. I will build my portfolio soon to show what I have learnt and my capabilities.
If anyone can give me advice on where to start and how I can become good at coding and working with data, please send a message :)
My university email is js20491@essex.ac.uk, alternatively you can reach my external e-mail is jakesparks10@gmail.com.
